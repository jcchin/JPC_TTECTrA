% This file includes the content for Controller Development section

All controllers in this study will have stacked PI controllers for set points and different limits in the Min-Max architecture\cite{Csank:2010}. This architecture is already available in the NASA Matlab Simulink environment called Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-Loop Transient Analysis \cite{Csank:2014} (TTECTrA). For this study TTECTrA will be used to develop controllers.
