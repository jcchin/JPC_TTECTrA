The control system features a subset of a standard aircraft engine controller\cite{Csank:2010}, mainly focusing on the parts of the controller which affect the dynamic performance and excluding steady-state limiters.  The control system features a power management system designed to regulate the controlled variable and deliver the desired thrust and a protection logic system to ensures safe operation while transitioning from one power level to another.  The protection logic system will contain two limiters; an acceleration controller designed to prevent high pressure compressor surge and exceeding the high pressure turbine inlet temperature, and a deceleration controller to prevent low pressure compressor surge and prevent exceeding the minimum fuel to air ratio.  These controllers will still be integrating using the standard MAX-MIN logic.  This architecture, and the functionality to design a controller, is already available in the NASA MATLAB/Simulink environment in the Tool for Turbine Engine Closed-Loop Transient Analysis \cite{Csank:2014} (TTECTrA). For this study TTECTrA will be used to develop controllers and execute the dynamic simulations.
