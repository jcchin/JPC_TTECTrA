A high BPR separate flow turbofan model in small single aisle (SSA) thrust class 
was developed using multi-design point cycle design \cite{Schutte:2012:2,
Schutte:2012:1} in Numerical Propulsion System Simulation. The modeled 
turbofan is in 28,000 lbf thrust class and the model is a transient model with only 
shaft dynamics. The design characteristics of the turbofan engine is given in 
\autoref{tbl:turbofan_design}.

In addition, modeling the VAFN will be discussed. The developed NPSS 
gas turbine model can also be included in a Matlab Simulink model for dynamic 
modeling or controller development.
