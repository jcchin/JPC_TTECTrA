% This file includes the content for the Gas Turbine Modeling section

A high BPR separate flow turbofan model in small single aisle (SSA) thrust class 
was developed using multi-design point cycle design \cite{Schutte:2012:2,
Schutte:2012:1} in NPSS. This section will include details about the gas turbine 
design. In addition, modeling the VAFN will be discussed. The developed NPSS 
gas turbine model can also be included in a Matlab Simulink model for dynamic 
modeling or controller development.
