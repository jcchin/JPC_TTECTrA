% This file contains the contents for the Conclusion section. It also includes  future work ideas.

In the conclusions section we will reiterate if the current SMA actuator 
performance is acceptable with or without a schedule. We will mention again 
whether they cause unacceptable thrust lapse or fan stall margin. If not, we will 
reemphasize how fast SMA actuators need to be for performance and safety.

For future work, the analysis can be redone for the two cases in this study when
SMA actuators are modeled with a higher fidelity instead of a first order lag. 
Also, transient performance with an SMA actuator can be compared against a 
hydraulic actuator. When reliable weight estimations for SMA and hydraulic 
actuators are available, how the actuators satisfying transient performance and
safety requirements affect aircraft mission performance due to additional weight
can be studies for different size vehicles.
